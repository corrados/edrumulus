- the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for flashing the micro controller firmware,
- some other software tools like [Hairless MIDI](https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial),
  [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html), etc., for using the Edrumulus MIDI output signal,
- [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave) software to control Edrumulus trigger parameter in real-time.
