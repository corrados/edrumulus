The aim of the Edrumulus project is to create a high quality Open Source e-drum trigger module software.

## Specifications

- The trigger performance shall be similar to the Roland TD-27.

- Overall latency should be as small as possible. The goal is to achieve a latency < 10 ms.

- Positional sensing shall be supported.

- A ESP32 micro processor development board (similar to the [open e-drums](https://open-e-drums.com)
  project) or a Teensy 4.0 development board shall be used. It has shown that both boards are
  powerful enough to fulfill the task of a drum trigger module.

- The required analog front end design shall be as simple as possible using the fewest number of
  parts possible.

  Many open drum trigger implementations only use one half of the signal (i.e., only the positive
  wave) or use a bridge rectifier to capture the analog signal. Since we want to implement more
  sophisticated algorithms, we want to capture the entire signal without non-linear analog
  preprocessing. Since micro controllers usually only convert analog signals in the range of 0 to 3.3 V,
  we have to move the point of operation in the middle of the voltage range.

## Algorithm

The algorithms are developed using a regular audio card. The drum pad output signal is captured and
the signal processing and algorithm development is done in Octave. The development runs in three steps:

1. Create the algorithms using a captured test signal and analyze it as a whole. This is the
   easiest and fastest way to create and improve the algorithms (this is the "playground"). The
   corresponding source file is algorithm/drumtrigger.m.

2. If the algorithm works ok, it is ported to a sample-based processing. The goal is to make the
   Octave code as similar to the C++ micro controller implementation as possible. The corresponding
   source file is algorithm/edrumulus.m.

3. Port the sample-based processing code to C++ and test it in real-time on the hardware. To make
   sure the port was successful, we send test data to the micro controller, query the processed
   signal and compare it in Octave to the reference code.

The algorithms are described in [this document](algorithm/README.md).
