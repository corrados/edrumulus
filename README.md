[![PlatformIO CI](https://github.com/corrados/edrumulus/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/corrados/edrumulus/actions/workflows/main.yml)

The aim of the **Edrumulus** project is to create a high quality Open Source e-drum trigger module software
which runs on a micro processor. It shall fulfill the following specifications:
- The trigger performance shall be similar to the Roland TD-27.
- Overall latency should be as small as possible. The goal is to achieve a latency < 10 ms.
- The required analog front end design shall be as simple as possible using the fewest number of
  parts possible.

and in the [discussion forums](https://github.com/corrados/edrumulus/discussions).


## Features

- Positional sensing
- Retrigger cancellation
- Rim shot/cymbol choke detection
- Cross talk cancellation
- Supported micro processor developer boards:
  - **ESP32 (dual core) DEVKIT V1 or similar**
  - **Teensy 4.0**


## Prototype hardware

  We want to capture the entire signal without non-linear analog preprocessing.
  Since micro controllers usually only convert analog signals in the range of 0 to 3.3 V,
  we have to move the point of operation in the middle of the voltage range.

  A circuit diagram of a simplified prototype which only supports a mono piezo pad and
  a hi-hat controller input is given in the following picture:

  The full circuit diagram of Prototype2 is given in [this PDF file](hardware/prototype2/edrumulus.pdf).

  *DISCLAIMER* All these circuit diagrams are used for my first prototypes and work fine for me. Use them
  at your own risk.


## Algorithm

The algorithms are developed using a regular audio card. The drum pad output signal is captured and
the signal processing and algorithm development is done in Octave. The development runs in three steps:

1. Create the algorithms using a captured test signal and analyze it as a whole. This is the
   easiest and fastest way to create and improve the algorithms (this is the "playground"). The
   corresponding source file is algorithm/drumtrigger.m.

2. If the algorithm works ok, it is ported to a sample-based processing. The goal is to make the
   Octave code as similar to the C++ micro controller implementation as possible. The corresponding
   source file is algorithm/edrumulus.m.

3. Port the sample-based processing code to C++ and test it in real-time on the hardware. To make
   sure the port was successful, we send test data to the micro controller, query the processed
   signal and compare it in Octave to the reference code.

The algorithms are described in [this document](algorithm/README.md).
