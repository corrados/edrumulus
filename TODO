- Hot spot suppression on mesh pads with center piezo
  -> striking directly on the piezo results in detected velocity values which are much too high

- rim shot detection possible bug: const float rim_metric_db = 10 * log10 ( rim_max_pow / first_peak_val );
  -> Shouldn't it be peak_val instead of first_peak_val?

- Signal overload correction
  -> maybe based on low-pass filtering as suggested in https://github.com/corrados/edrumulus/discussions/17#discussion-3736264

- Improve dynamics for Drumgizmo (for official drum kits as well as self-recorded kit)
  MIDI file 1:10:127 -> reference -> record audio -> DGEdit -> check the estimated powers

- Create pad parameter set for CY-5

- Create pad parameter set for PDX-8

- Create pad parameter set for HD-1 tom pad

- Create pad parameter set for PD-6

- Create pad parameter set for KD-8

- Documentation: Algorithm description

- Attach second piezo on mesh pad and experiment with improved velocity/position detection using the second piezo signal

- Improve Edrumulus/Drumgizmo usage on Raspberry Pi (Pi 3+ and Pi Zero)

- Create Qt application for controlling Edrumulus via MIDI using the rtmidi library

- Create PCB for Prototype2 based on ESP32

- Documentation: Edrumulus manual which describes the hardware/software setup, parameter description, HOWTOs, etc.

- support hardware keyboard/display like Arduino LCD1602 Display Keypad Shield
